# Data-Visualization-for-SAIL-Dataset

The project consists of python scripts generated for concatenation, analysis(plotting) of CSV files from SAIL data of 02 November, 2021. The CSV file generated consists of rows including: parameter, start time, end time,  duration for complete data of 02.11.2021.
 To execute this code:
 1- Concatenate all the files as done in the concatenation python scripts.
 2-Plot all the concatenated files using the plot python scripts.
 3-Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest in the anomaly python scripts.
 4-If you want the anomalies in terms of intervals then use the anomaly_interval python script.
This file also contains two docs which contain the plots for all the HMD and 1_Drive parameters.
This file also contains two csv files which contain all the timestamps of the anomalies.
